# Session Management in Next.js

This project serves as a hands-on exploration of session management in web applications, specifically using Next.js, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and SQLite.

In this project, I built a simple two-page site that restricts access to a protected page based on user authentication. Utilizing JSON Web Tokens (JWT), I established a live session that persists until the token expires.
